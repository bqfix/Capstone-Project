# Capstone-Project

### Description
This app is designed to assist with tabletop gaming, by allowing the user to virtually roll dice and create favorite dice sets.  
Results are also recorded for future reference.
All data is stored in the cloud via Firebase, to allow for users with multiple devices to access their history and favorites across their devices.

### What I accomplished in this project:

* Implemented Firebase AdMob, Analytics, Authentication, and Realtime Database.
* Stored data entirely in a cloud format, and ensured that data is always up-to-date, without excess calls to the database.
* Allowed user data to be accessed across multiple devices by providing authentication via Google account or e-mail.
* Designed a UI that is responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes and orientations.
* Positioned ads prominently, while not being hindering to the user.
* Included a widget to allow access to favorites from the home-screen, that passes data directly to the application and opens it for ease-of-use.
* Implemented numerous redundant checks to ensure the accuracy of data, and prevent large calculations from locking the UI.
